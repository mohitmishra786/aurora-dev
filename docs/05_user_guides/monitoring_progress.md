## The Dashboard View

When you run `aurora run`, your terminal transforms into a command center.

- **Left Pane:** The Agent Logs. You can see the `Backend Agent` typing code or the `Test Engineer` running `pytest`.
- **Right Pane:** The Task List. Items turn from `[ ]` (Pending) to `[/]` (In Progress) to `[x]` (Done).
- **Bottom Pane:** System Status (CPU, Memory, API Costs).

## The Web Dashboard

For a graphical view, open `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`.
Here you can see:
- **Dependency Graph:** A visual node map of tasks.
- **Artifacts:** Code files, diagrams, and PDFs generated by agents.
- **Cost Tracker:** Real-time spend analysis.

## Interrupting Execution

If you see an agent doing something wrong (e.g., deleting a file you need), press `Ctrl+C`. This pauses the `Maestro Agent`. You can then:
- **Modify Instructions:** "Don't delete `user.py`."
- **Manually Edit:** Open the file in VS Code, fix it, and save.
- **Resume:** Press `Enter` to continue.
