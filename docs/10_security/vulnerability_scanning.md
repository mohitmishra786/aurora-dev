## Container Scanning

We use **Trivy** in the CI pipeline.
It scans the OS packages (Alpine/Debian) inside the Docker image.
Policy: No HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities allowed in production images.

## Dependency Scanning

We use **Dependabot** and **Snyk**.
They monitor `poetry.lock` and `package-lock.json`.
PRs are automatically created when a patch is available.

## DAST (Dynamic Analysis)

We run **OWASP ZAP** weekly against the staging environment.
It spiders the API and tries to inject payloads.
